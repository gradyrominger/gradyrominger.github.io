## Day 1 – Cert Sprint Kickoff
Reflection: Course 1 feels elementary, but I’m reframing it as a warm-up. Using this time to scaffold my repo and commit rituals.

## Day 2 – Finished Course 1
Reflection: Blazed through course 1. Set playing speed to 1.25x. Even though Course 1 is easy, I used it as a refresher on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Intro to React. Used it to establish rhythm.
